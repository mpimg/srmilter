Hi buczek,

for the first time since Codeberg's launch in 2019, we are updating our Privacy Policy. With this update, we want to strengthen your rights that you have as a user of Codeberg. We hope that you will feel the same way. Our new version aims to achieve the following goals:
- Continue to ensure full GDPR compliance
- Be more clear and transparent
- Place stricter limitations on how Codeberg's services and operators may process your data
- Include additional information on how we handle personal data related to the activities of our association (this only affects present and past members of Codeberg e. V.), as well as who may handle the data of our association's present and past members.

Read our new Privacy Policy here: https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/commit/2bad44ef35bfc2e154d2c3168bf44d1be739528d/PrivacyPolicy.md

As a user of Codeberg.org, we inform you that the new Privacy Policy will take effect on **October 2nd, 2025**.

Best,
Your Codeberg e. V. Team
